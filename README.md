# ampersand-collection

A way to store/manage objects or models.

Unlike other tools this makes no assumptions about how it's going to be used or what type of models it is going to contain. This makes it a very flexible/useful tool for modeling all kinds of stuff.

It does not require underscore or jQuery, but instead makes it easy to extend with those methods if you'd like.

## massive flexibility

The collection is a fairly low-level tool, in that it's useful for any time you want to be able to store JS objects in an array.

In many ways it's simply an observable array of objects.

It emits `add`, `remove` events and makes it possible to merge in a set of objects into an existing collection and emit change events appropriately.

If you extend it with a `.model` property that contains a constructor, the collection will ensure that objects that don't match that constructor are instantiated before being added to the collection.

For example:

```js
var Collection = require('ampersand-collection');

// can just store plain objects
var basicCollection = new Collection([
    {name: 'larry'},
    {name: 'curly'},
    {name: 'moe'}
]);
```

Adding [ampersand-collection-rest-mixin](https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-collection-rest-mixin) and [ampersand-collection-underscore-mixin](http://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-collection-underscore-mixin). 

```js
var Collection = require('ampersand-collection');
var restMixin = require('ampersand-collection-rest-mixin');
var underscoreMixin = require('ampersand-collection-underscore-mixin');


// or we can extend it with underscore and REST methods
// to turn it into something similar to a Backbone Collection
var RestfulCollection = Collection.extend(underscoreMixin, restMixin, {
    url: '/mystuff'
});

var collection = new RestfulCollection();

// does ajax request
collection.fetch();
```

## A quick note about instanceof checks

With npm and browserify for module deps you can sometimes end up with a situation where, the same `collection` constructor wasn't used to build a `collection` object. As a result `instanceof` checks will fail. 

In order to deal with this (because sometimes this is a legitimate scenario), `collection` simply creates a read-only `isCollection` property on all collection objects that can be used to check whether or a not a given object is in fact a collection object no matter what its constructor was.

## API Reference

### extend `AmpersandCollection.extend([attributes])`

Create a collection class of your own by extending AmpersandCollection, providing the required instance properties to be attached instances of your class.

Typically you will specify a `model` constructor (if you are storing [ampersand-state](#ampersand-state) or [ampersand-model](#ampersand-model) objects.

### model `collection.model`

Override this property to specify the model class that the collection contains. If defined, you can pass raw attributes objects (and arrays) to `add` and `reset`, and the attributes will be converted into a model of the proper type.

```javascript
var Library = AmpersandCollection.extend({
    model: Book
});
```

A collection can also contain polymorphic models by overriding this property with a function that returns a model.

*Please note* that if you do this, you'll also want to overwrite `isModel` method with your own so you can describe the logic that should be used to determine whether an object is already an instantiated model or not.

```javascript
var Library = AmpersandCollection.extend({

  model: function(attrs, options) {
    if (condition) {
      return new PublicDocument(attrs, options);
    } else {
      return new PrivateDocument(attrs, options);
    }
  },

  isModel: function (model) {
    return model instanceof PublicDocument || model instanceof PrivateDocument;
  }

});
```


### constructor/initialize `new AmpersandCollection([models], [options])`

When creating an AmpersandCollection, you may choose to pass in the initial array of **models**. The collection's [comparator](#comparator) may be included as an option. If you define an **initialize** function, it will be invoked when the collection is created. There are a couple of options that, if provided, are attached to the collection directly: `model`, `comparator` and `parent`.

```javascript
var people = new AmpersandCollection([{ name: 'phil' }, { name: 'bob' }, { name: 'jane' }], {
    model: Person
});
```

### mainIndex `collection.mainIndex`

Specify which property on your models should be used by the collection as the main index and unique identifier for the models/objects it holds. This is the property that [`get`](#ampersand-collection-get) will use to retrieve models by and what `add`, `set`, and `remove` will use to determine whether a model already exists in the collection or not. 

If you specify a [`model`](http://ampersandjs.com/docs#ampersand-collection-model) property in the collection and that model specifies an [`idAttribute`](http://ampersandjs.com/docs#ampersand-state-idattribute) the collection will use *that* as the `mainIndex` unless you set it to something else explicitly.

If *no* `mainIndex` or `model` is specified `"id"` is used as the default `mainIndex`.

This means, that *most* of the time you don't need to set `mainIndex` and things will still Just Work™.

But if you wish, you may set it while extending AmpersandCollection like so:

```javascript
var People = AmpersandCollection.extend({
    mainIndex: '_id'
});
```

### indexes `collections.indexes`

Specify an optional array of keys by which to additionally index the models in your collection (in addition to the `mainIndex`. This allows you to quickly retrieve models by specifying the key to use with [get](#ampersand-collection-get).

Note that `get` will only ever return a single model, so the values of these indexes should be unique across the models in the collection:

```javascript
var People = AmpersandCollection.extend({
    mainIndex: '_id',

    indexes: ['otherId']
});

var people = new People.add([
    { _id: 1, otherId: 'a', name: 'Phil' },
    { _id: 2, otherId: 'b', name: 'Julie' },
    { _id: 3, otherId: 'c', name: 'Henrik' },
    { _id: 4, otherId: 'd', name: 'Jenn' }
]);

people.get(1) //=> { _id: 1, otherId: 'a', name: 'Phil' }

people.get('b', 'otherId') //=> { _id: 2, otherId: 'b', name: 'Julie' },
```


### length `collection.length`

Returns the length of the underlying array.


### isCollection/instanceof `collection.isCollection`
With npm and browserify for module deps you can sometimes end up with a situation where, the same `collection` constructor wasn't  used to build a `collection` object. As a result `instanceof` checks will fail.

In order to deal with this (because sometimes this is a legitimate scenario), `collection` simply creates a read-only `isCollection` property on all collection objects that can be used to check whether or a not a given object is in fact a collection object no matter what its constructor was.


### add `collection.add(modelOrObject, [options])`

Add a model (or an array of models) to the collection, firing an `"add"` event. If a [model](#ampersand-collection-model) property is defined, you may also pass raw attributes objects, and have them be vivified as instances of the model. Returns the added (or preexisting, if duplicate) models.

**Options:**

* Pass `{at: index}` to splice the model into the collection at the specified index.
* If you're adding models to the collection that are already in the collection, they'll be ignored, unless you pass `{merge: true}`, in which case their attributes will be merged into the corresponding models, firing any appropriate `"change"` events.

```javascript
var ships = new AmpersandCollection();

ships.on("add", function(ship) {
  console.log("Ahoy " + ship.name + "!");
});

ships.add([
  {name: "Flying Dutchman"},
  {name: "Black Pearl"}
]);

//logs:
//- "Ahoy Flying Dutchman!"
//- "Ahoy Black Pearl!"
```

Note that adding the same model (a model with the same id) to a collection more than once is a no-op.


### serialize `collection.serialize()`

Serialize the collection into a plain javascript array, ready for sending to the server (typically called via [toJSON](#ampersand-collection-tojson)). Will also call `serialize()` on each model in the collection.

### toJSON `collection.toJSON()`

Returns a plain javascript array of the models in the collection (which are also serialized) ready for sending to the server. The name of this method is a bit confusing, as it doesn't actually return a JSON string — but I'm afraid that it's the way that the JavaScript API for JSON.stringify works.

```javascript
var collection = new AmpersandCollection([
    {name: "Tim", age: 5},
    {name: "Ida", age: 26},
    {name: "Rob", age: 55}
]);

console.log(JSON.stringify(collection));
//=> "[{\"name\":\"Tim\",\"age\":5},{\"name\":\"Ida\",\"age\":26},{\"name\":\"Rob\",\"age\":55}]"
```


### set `collection.set(models, [options])`

The **set** method performs a "smart" update of the collection with the passed list of models. If a model in the list isn't yet in the collection it will be added; if the model is already in the collection its attributes will be merged; and if the collection contains any models that aren't present in the list, they'll be removed. All of the appropriate `"add"`, `"remove"`, and `"change"` events are fired as this happens. Returns the touched models in the collection. If you'd like to customize the behavior, you can disable it with options: `{add: false}`, `{remove: false}`, or `{merge: false}`.

```javascript
var vanHalen = new AmpersandCollection([eddie, alex, stone, roth]);

vanHalen.set([eddie, alex, stone, hagar]);

// Fires a "remove" event for roth, and an "add" event for "hagar".
// Updates any of stone, alex, and eddie's attributes that may have
// changed over the years.
```

### get `collection.get(query, [indexName])`

Retrieve a model from the collection by index.

With an unspecified `indexName` (`collection.get(123)`) retrieves the model by it's [mainIndex](#ampersand-collection-mainindex) attribute.

Or specify an `indexName` to retrieve a model by any of the other listed [indexes](#ampersand-collection-indexes).

```javascript
var People = AmpersandCollection.extend({
    mainIndex: '_id',

    indexes: ['otherId']
});

var people = new People.add([
    { _id: 1, otherId: 'a', name: 'Phil' },
    { _id: 2, otherId: 'b', name: 'Julie' },
    { _id: 3, otherId: 'c', name: 'Henrik' },
    { _id: 4, otherId: 'd', name: 'Jenn' }
]);

people.get(1) //=> { _id: 1, otherId: 'a', name: 'Phil' }

people.get('b', 'otherId') //=> { _id: 2, otherId: 'b', name: 'Julie' },
```


### at `collection.at(index)`

Get a model from a collection, specified by index. Useful if your collection is sorted, and if your collection isn't sorted, at will still retrieve models in insertion order.

e.g. `collection.at(0)` returns the first model in the collection.

### remove `collection.remove(models, [options])`

Remove a model (or an array of models) from the collection, and returns them. Fires a `"remove"` event, which you can use `{ silent: true }` to suppress. The model's index before removal is available to listeners as `options.index`.

The models object/array can be references to actual models, or just a list of ids to remove.


### reset `collection.reset(models, [options])`

Adding and removing models one at a time is all well and good, but sometimes you have so many models to change that you'd rather just update the collection in bulk. Use **reset** to replace a collection with a new list of models (or attribute hashes), triggering a single `"reset"` event at the end. Returns the newly-set models. For convenience, within a `"reset"` event, the list of any previous models is available as `options.previousModels`.

Calling `collection.reset()` without passing any models as arguments will empty the entire collection.

### sort `collection.sort([options])`

Force a collection to re-sort itself. You don't need to call this under normal circumstances, as a collection with a comparator will sort itself whenever a model is added. To disable sorting when adding a model, pass `{sort: false}` to add. Calling sort triggers a `"sort"` event on the collection.


### models `collection.models`

Raw access to the JavaScript array of models inside of the collection. Usually you'll want to use `get`, `at`, or the [proxied array methods](#ampersand-collection-proxied-es5-array-methods-9) to access model objects, but occasionally a direct reference to the array is desired.

### comparator

Comparator option lets you define how models within a given collection will be sorted. There're a few ways to declare your comparator:

* Passing `false` will prevent sorting
* Passing `string` will sort collection by a specific model attribute
* Passing `function` will use native array sort function, which you can define with either 1 argument (each model one by one) or more, which lets you write custom compare functions with next 2 models as arguments

### proxied ES5 array methods (9)

The base AmpersandCollection proxies some basic ES5 methods to the underlying model array. Further documentation of these methods is available at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Iteration_methods)

* indexOf
* lastIndexOf
* every
* some
* forEach
* each (alias for forEach)
* map
* filter
* reduce
* reduceRight

Unlike a backbone collection it does not include underscore and all the array methods from underscore, though if you wish more functions than those built into modern browsers, you can mixin [ampersand-collection-underscore-mixin](https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-collection-underscore-mixin) to get them.

```javascript
var people = People([
    { name: 'Phil', hatColor: 'red' },
    { name: 'Jenn', hatColor: 'green' },
    { name: 'Henrik', hatColor: 'blue' },
    { name: 'Julie', hatColor: 'yellow' }
]);

people.map(function (person) { return person.name; }) //=> ['Phil', 'Jenn', 'Henrik', 'Julie']

people.filter(function (person) {
    return person.name[0] === 'J';
}) //=> ['Jenn', 'Julie']
```
